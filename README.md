# ethIndexerAPI

Hey Hi! <br>
Abhishek here<br>
This is submission to [challenge](https://www.notion.so/Backend-Engineer-c3bc14e4fad04b40a486d5cbdad83093) proposed by you, the Matic team! <br>
Basically, I had to index Kovan net for the latest 10k blocks and store that in the database and expose that DB by API.

# My Approach

There were multiple instances, where I had to make choice, <br>
The following are some of them. <br>
Cheers üç∑

**1 Requests to endpoint**<br>
My first thought was to request blocks one by one.<br>
But, in search of an optimized solution, I found **Batch requests**, which decrease the load on network traffic by doing requests in the batch.<br>
So here, 10000 blocks are requested in batches of 100<br>
There is a problem with this approach though, as batch.execute() doesn't return promise or has a callback, you can't tell when the batch is done executing.<br>
Performance ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  <br>
Reliability ‚¨áÔ∏è<br>
[ Solved using  <br>
 "**retry(blockNumber, web3)**" in controllers/ dbcontroller.js<br>
Aim : For the requests failed in batch<br>
Desc: Some requests may get ECONNRESET, depending on our call frequency and connection<br>
For them, we are doing one by one (sync), by putting a good amount of time between each API call.]<br>

**2 Programming Model (Async/Sync)**<br>
Given requests are independent of each other, the async model is the best choice.<br>
Performance ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  <br>
Reliability ‚¨áÔ∏è<br>
[ Solved using same<br>
 "**retry(blockNumber, web3)**]<br>
 
**3 Database Schema**<br>
My first thought was to keep the user as key and all the tx details as value.<br>
But then I realized that I am repeating tx details for both the "From" and "To" account.<br>
So I was storing a lot of reductant data.<br>
Then I optimized it by dividing a single model into two models<br>
One for User -> Tx Hash <br>
One for TxHash -> Details <br>
Efficiency ‚¨ÜÔ∏è  <br>

**4 API Load balancing**<br>
At first, I was requesting from only one endpoint, then I created 3 for better performance<br>

##  Instructions

 1. Copy paste secret.json sent over mail into the config folder (If not received ping me on abhivisput33@gmail.com)<br>
 2. npm start<br>
 
 ### API Calls
 1. To Index 10k blocks from latest block : **localhost:3000/api/genesis**
 2. To get tx of user : **localhost:3000/api/getdetails/:address** 
 3. To get all transactions : **localhost:3000/api/getalltx**
 4. To get All users : **localhost:3000/api/getallusers**
